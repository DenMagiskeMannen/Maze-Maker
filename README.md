Hello there!
This is a maze maker of my own making, using some non-traditional oop to make the grid. The dimentions of which are given with the "length" variable inside the file itself. Currently you can, make a maze, then press "y" to make enterences and then solve said maze. Infinite possible perfect mazes. 
Buttons that do anything arrreeee: "Y, W,A,S,D".
